<h2>Syscoin development team founded in 2022, organization originated in 2012</h2>

<body>   
<p>In 2012 after graduating college with a degree in network design and security I started my own company assisting
 	local business in upgrades according to their IT needs. I specialized in taking on difficult clients that refused
 	to pay for proper IT support. I would source everything from ebay and for pennies on the dollar provide them with 
 	increased productivity and the highest security possible. Unfortunately due to my MS the business fizzled out later 
	in the decade.</p> 
    
 <p>I have started to work now as a Syscoin cryptocurrency developer and am bringing back the name for an organization 
 	that is dedicated to making the Syscoin ecosystem the best and most secure it can be. We have two projects under our
 	umbrella to start. Suscoin SUS and Uttkoin UTTKE both available on Pegasys DEX on the Syscoin NEVM network. Our first completed project was to bridge Suscoin to the UTXO chain of Syscoin to provide the highest security for long term 
 	storage.</p>
		
    
    
    
    	To be a part of it you do not have to reveal identity, I use my real name as the face of two projects but 
		you have the option of going by your .sys Syscoin name service domain unlike say, a Discord handle that can
		be changed.
    
      
   
    
<h3>If you are interested in joining we welcome all Syscoin projects but they must have these same objectives in mind:</h3>
    
	
		Follow best practices always
					
		Use the most secure methods even if it sacrifices speed (ex: for a transfer between exchanges use PoW backed
					
		LTC over something like XLM that is instant but not as secure)
					
		Self host when possible using open source products
					
		Work to move projects away from centralized infrastructure like AWS
					
		Keep personal info secure and private (ex: use Proton mail, not gmail)
		


<h4>I'm still very new to coding and development but I feel the trade between my security and infrastructure knowledge and 
the communities skills, we can work to all make Syscoin and it's products the best they can be.</h4>
